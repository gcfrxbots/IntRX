#
# These scripts are built to work in every game. 
# They can be added to your IntRX by adding the script to the "file name to run" column in the "Global" tab of InteractConfig.
#
# The source code for each .exe is available in the /IntRX/Resources/Included Scripts folder. Remember to copy any changes back to the UserScripts folder.
#
# Feel free to remove any of these scripts from UserScripts. They're simply here to give you some fun options out of the box that work with any game.

BlockInput - Blocks your input, meaning all keys you press won't do anything. Any keys you had held down when the script started will remain held until it ends.

Charge - Forces you to run forward and attack repeatedly.

FlipInput - Reverses your movement controls. So W is S, A is D, etc. Also changes jump to E because Grant likes it that way and if I cant be right then ill make all of you wrong

Freeze - Exactly like BlockInput, but any keys being held when the script starts will be released before your input is blocked.

SpamKey - When doing this command, users will specify a key, and that key will be spammed. For example, "!spamkey Space" will spam the Spacebar. Only one key can be spammed, so dont worry about getting alt+f4'd

TerribleAim - Moves the mouse around eratically. Most effective in first person games. Doesn't really do too much in some games.
