# These scripts are built to work in every game. 
# They can be added to your IntRX by adding the script to the "file name to run" column in the "Global" tab of InteractConfig.
#
# If you wish to edit any of these scripts, you can find the uncompiled .ahk files in the /IntRX/Resources/Included Scripts folder. Remember to move the edited scripts to your UserScripts folder and recompile them!
#
# Feel free to remove any of these scripts from UserScripts. They're simply here to give you some fun options out of the box that work with any game.
#
# IMPORTANT: Some of these scripts will not work unless IntRX is being run as administrator, which we highly recommend doing anyway!

BadAim - Moves the mouse around eratically. Most effective in shooters and first person games, might not do much in certain games.

BlockInput - Blocks your input, meaning all keys you press won't do anything. Any keys you had held down when the script started will remain held until it ends.

Charge - Forces you to run forward and attack repeatedly (i.e. hold W and spam left click).

FlipInput - Reverses your movement controls. So W is S, A is D, etc. Also swaps E and Spacebar because Grant uses E as his jump keybind and I want everyone to tell him how insane he is.

Freeze - Exactly like BlockInput, but any keys being held when the script starts will be released before your input is blocked.

SpamKey - When doing this command, users will specify a key, and that key will be spammed. For example, "!spamkey Space" will spam the Spacebar. Only one key can be spammed, so don't worry about users spamming keyboard shortcuts like Alt+F4.
