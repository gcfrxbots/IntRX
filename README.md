# This is a beta version of IntRX built to connect to Casterlabs

As a part of an upcoming integration with Casterlabs, IntRX is being built to run on Casterlabs.co Koi servers that connect to many streaming services such as Twitch, Caffeine, Youtube, Trovo, Brime, and Glimesh. IntRX is being redesigned from the ground up to work with every one of those services, and benefit from Koi's upgraded functionality allowing IntRX to get access to things like subscriber data, donation amount data, channel rewards, etc.
