IntRX (pronounced like "Interax") is a unique Twitch bot which allows viewers to directly interact with the streamer's game using chat commands. Several games are supported by default, such as Minecraft, Skyrim, Fallout 4, and Subnautica, but IntRX also allows its users to add support for any game they want with relative ease. Join our Discord to share custom scripts, or download scripts that others have shared!
